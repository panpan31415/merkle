### I run out of time

some HTML rests are copied from my previous projects.

The reason why I slow was I have to figure out what kind of app I am going to build.

here is how I did it.

I searched internet and found a website that is close to this assignment.
so I used is as my prototype.

here is the [website](https://new.axilthemes.com/demo/template/papr/home-4.html)

later I collected pictures, fonts. and save those pictures to a AWS S3
bucket.

the total coding time was about 8 hours.

I know, it was too long, I just
want to make sure the final site should look as close as the original.
but I run out of time.
